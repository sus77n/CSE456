1: Is the layered design as shown above (II) reasonable? If not, how should it be revised?

The 3-layer design is reasonable for small to medium applications as it separates concerns clearly: 
the Presentation Layer handles user interaction, the Service Layer manages business logic, and the Data Layer defines payment strategies. 
For larger applications, adding layers like Controller or Repository can improve organization and scalability.
